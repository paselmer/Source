Hi Steve,

I am glad to hear about your interest in using the DEM that Simone Tanelli and Gregg Dobrowalski developed at JPL, initially for CloudSat processing, and now for CALIPSO processing as well.

Attached are the documentation and software files:

DEM_description.txt - text file explaining the format of the DEM file

C_DEM.h - DEM C++ class header file
C_DEM.cpp - DEM C++ class file
Main.cpp - C++ file with an example calling the C_DEM class to read the DEM

You should also talk with Mark and his CALIPSO team to see what software routines they have developed for accessing the DEM.

Following are the FTP site and credentials where you can retrieve the CloudSat DEM file:

csftp2.cira.colostate.edu

calipso
jpldem

The file is gzipped to make it smaller and easier to transfer (1GB instead of the uncompressed 6GB).

Let me know when you have retrieved the DEM file so I can remove it from our server.

Thanks!
Dale
